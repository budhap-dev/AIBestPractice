# Copilot Field Guide

A static web app that teaches everyday GitHub Copilot habits in VS Code: keeping the context focused, spending AI credits wisely, choosing the right chat mode, writing prompts that land, and reviewing everything before it ships.

It works as a live demo for a team session and as a reference people keep open next to their editor.

## Who it's for

- **End users:** ASDA developers who use GitHub Copilot in VS Code, from first-week users to daily power users. They keep the guide open next to their editor as an everyday reference.
- **Demo audience:** ASDA engineering teams in a live session: developers, tech leads and engineering managers with mixed Copilot experience.

Both lines show on the home page, and the demo audience shows on the first slide. Edit them in `src/content/meta.json`.

## What's inside

Each section has its own page, with previous and next links at the bottom. Pages use hash URLs such as `#/cheat-sheet` or `#/cheat-sheet/cmd-compact` for a single item, so links can be shared and old `#cmd-compact` links still work.

| Section | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Why it matters | How a feature used to get built, a **then and now** diagram, what the research says (with sources), the catch, and the five habits that decide which side you land on. |
| Key terms | Plain-English definitions of every AI, Copilot and coding word the guide uses, grouped, each with an everyday comparison, and an animated **what happens when you press Enter** diagram. Every other page lists the **words on this page**, linking each to its definition. |
| How context works | What fills the context window, and why every prompt re-sends (and re-bills) all of it. Includes a **context stack** diagram and the interactive **context meter**. |
| Prompt cost | Animated diagrams of the same bug fixed with a vague prompt and a focused one, showing how re-sent history snowballs, plus the anatomy of a good prompt. |
| Chat modes | Ask, Plan and Agent, and when to use each, with a cost staircase diagram. Edit is deprecated. |
| Cheat sheet | A **prefixes** diagram (what `/`, `#` and `@` do), slash commands, `#` context, `@` participants, shortcuts (macOS / Windows), context and model settings. |
| Daily workflow | A **daily loop** diagram, a seven-step routine, a "when the chat gets long" decision guide and a daily checklist. |
| Do's and don'ts | Grouped by context & cost, prompting, reviewing and security, each with a one-line why. |
| Team memory | Instruction files, prompt files, custom agents, AGENTS.md and skills, with example files. |
| Prompt templates | Copyable prompts plus a **prompt builder**. |
| Test yourself | A scenario quiz. |
| Security | An **approval gate** diagram, approvals, auto-approve, sandboxing, content exclusion and public code. |
| Beyond the editor | Commit messages, terminal chat, smart actions, PR review and the cloud agent. |
| Wrap-up | Seven takeaways, each linking back to its section. |

Most sections end with **Did you know?** facts, each with a docs link. Each page header carries its section's picture. Small wins get confetti: a right quiz answer, a finished checklist and the end of the deck. Confetti, pictures and diagram animations are still when the system asks for reduced motion.

## Presenter mode

Select **Present** in the top bar, or **Present the guide** on the home page, to run the guide as a slide deck. Starting from a section page opens the deck at that section. The deck is built from the same content files, so it stays in sync with the guide.

The deck opens as a **short talk**: 26 slides, about 13 minutes of reading (allow 25 to 30 minutes live), covering the opening story, the key diagrams, three quiz scenarios, the approval gate, the takeaways and the surprise ending. Press **S**, or use the picker in the toolbar, to switch to the **full deck** of 104 slides and back. You stay on the same slide, or move to the next one in the talk. Nothing is cut from the guide or the full deck: they stay for people to read afterwards. In the overview (**O**), slides the short talk skips are dimmed, and picking one switches to the full deck at that slide. Edit the running order in `src/content/talk.json`.

Each press of → reveals the next point on a slide, then moves to the next slide. Quiz slides show the options one by one and reveal the answer last.

Every slide has a picture from a shared set of hand-coded SVG scenes. Every teaching slide ends with a two-line story about two developers: **Asha**, who has the habit (**How it helps**), and **Ben**, who falls into the trap (**Wrong practice**). The story is the last thing revealed. The first slide that uses a glossary word shows a **New word** note with its one-line definition, so no word appears before it is explained.

The deck looks like a presentation: the slide sits on a stage with a footer and slide number, and **D** (or the design picker) switches between five slide designs: Classic, Bold, Paper, Blueprint and Spotlight. Designs work with every colour theme, in light and dark.

After **Questions?** there is a surprise: press → to find out. Its last slides are **One prompt can build this app**, linking to [prompts/build-this-app.md](prompts/build-this-app.md), and a **Thank you for your patience** slide.

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| → Space PgDn | Next point or slide |
| ← Shift+Space PgUp | Previous point or slide |
| Home / End | First or last slide |
| O | Overview of all slides |
| S | Switch between the short talk and the full deck |
| F | Fullscreen |
| T | Next transition: Slide, Fade, Zoom, Flip, Page turn, Cube, Wipe, Circle, Rise, Random |
| D | Next slide design: Classic, Bold, Paper, Blueprint, Spotlight |
| B | Blank the screen |
| ? | Show the shortcuts |
| Esc | Leave presenter mode, back to the current section's page |

Every slide shows an estimated time to read in the bottom bar, with the reading time left in the deck. The overview shows each slide's time and the total: about 13 minutes for the short talk, 55 minutes for the full deck. Times assume 200 words per minute; change `readingWordsPerMinute` in `meta.json` to suit your audience.

On touch screens, swipe left or right. The toolbar hides after a few seconds without mouse movement. Slide layouts live in `src/presenter/deck.ts`.

## Themes

The palette button in the top bar sets the appearance (system, light or dark) and one of six accent colours: Teal, Ocean, Grape, Rose, Ember and Graphite. Every colour passes WCAG AA contrast in both appearances. The choice is saved in the browser. Colours are defined in `src/styles.css` under "Colour themes".

## Run it

Requires Node 24.

```bash
npm ci
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Other scripts: `npm run build` (type-check and build to `dist/`), `npm run lint`, `npm run preview`.

## Host it

`npm run build` produces a fully static `dist/` folder with relative paths. Routing uses the URL hash, so the host needs no rewrite rules. Copy it to any internal static host or sub-folder. There's no backend, analytics or external CDN.

## Edit the content

All text lives in typed JSON files in [`src/content/`](src/content). You don't need to touch React to change it.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `meta.json` | Company name, owner, end users, demo audience, reading speed, last-reviewed date, AI policy link, repository link, and `siteUrl` for the "open it on your phone" QR code (empty uses the current address) |
| `sections.json` | Section order, nav labels, titles and intros |
| `opening.json` | The Why it matters story: the old way, research figures with sources, the catch and the five factors |
| `context.json`, `modes.json`, `commands.json` | Mental model cards, chat modes, cheat sheet rows |
| `workflow.json` | Workflow steps, long-chat decisions, checklist items |
| `rules.json` | Do's and don'ts |
| `memory.json`, `templates.json` | Team memory files and prompt templates |
| `quiz.json`, `meter.json` | Quiz scenarios and the context meter's actions and models |
| `security.json`, `beyond.json` | Security and beyond-the-editor cards |
| `glossary.json` | Key terms in three groups (AI, Copilot, coding): one-line definition, full definition, everyday comparison, and `match` patterns that detect the word in any text |
| `stories.json` | For each slide id: its picture (`scene`), a one-line `hook` for section openers, and Asha's `helps` and Ben's `wrong` lines for teaching slides (30 words each at most; use the names, never pronouns) |
| `finale.json` | The words on the surprise ending |
| `talk.json` | The slide ids the short talk presents, in deck order. New word notes, quiz numbers and timings are worked out for the talk on its own |
| `promptCost.json` | The vague and focused prompt scenarios (illustrative token counts) and the prompt anatomy |
| `diagrams.json` | Text and numbers for every diagram: request flow, modes staircase, long-chat flowchart, team memory, then and now, context stack, daily loop, approval gate and prefixes |
| `facts.json` | Did you know? facts, each tied to a section and a source |
| `summary.json` | Wrap-up takeaways |

Every item can carry:

- `sourceUrl`: link to the official doc that backs the claim (shown as "Source").
- `verify: true`: shows a "Needs verification" badge. Add the item to [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md).

The types in [`src/content/types.ts`](src/content/types.ts) catch missing fields at build time. In development (`npm run dev`) the console warns about any teaching slide without a story.

If you add a word to the content that a newcomer might not know, add it to `glossary.json`. The page term links and the deck's New word notes pick it up automatically.

### Before a demo

1. Fill in `company`, `owner` and `policyUrl` in `meta.json`.
2. Re-check [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md). Copilot changes monthly.
3. Update `lastReviewed`.

## How this was built

[prompts/build-this-app.md](prompts/build-this-app.md) is a single self-contained prompt that recreates the whole app. [prompts/content-revision.md](prompts/content-revision.md) is the brief for the story, pictures and plain-words revision. [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) holds the phase-by-phase prompts for building this with Copilot Agent mode, using the same habits the guide teaches. [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) is the spec, and [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) carries state between chats.
